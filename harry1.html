<h1>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h1>
<p>When Harry enters his sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the world is in turmoil. Voldemort's army is gaining force and momentum, and tragedies are everyday occurrences. 
The Muggle world is experiencing great loss and havoc as well, and fear abounds. The Prime Minister of the Muggle world meets with both the former and current Ministers of Magic, and the news is not good. It would seem that a war is at hand, and even Hogwarts isn't entirely safe.</p>
