<h1>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1</h1>
<p>As Harry, Ron, and Hermione race against time and evil to destroy the Horcruxes, they uncover the existence of the three most powerful objects in the wizarding world: the Deathly Hallows.

    Voldemort's power is growing stronger. He now has control over the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to finish Dumbledore's work and find the rest of the Horcruxes to defeat the Dark Lord. But little hope remains for the trio and the rest of the Wizarding World, so everything they do must go as planned.
    
    
    Harry, Ron and Hermione begin their mission to find the Horcruxes, the keys to Voldemort's immortality, but nowhere is safe now that Voldemort has gained control over Hogwarts and the Wizarding World.</p>
